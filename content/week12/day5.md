## Salary Negotiation

### Research Phase

```javascript
// Salary research sources
- Levels.fyi: Real salaries by company
- Blind: Anonymous employee data
- Glassdoor: Public reviews
- LinkedIn: Market rates
- Salary.com: Calculator

Factors affecting salary:
- Experience level
- Location (SF: +50%, India: -60%)
- Company size (Google: +30%)
- Industry (Finance: +40%)
- Skills (ML/DevOps: +30%)
```

### Negotiation Strategy

```
Before negotiating:
1. Know market rate (do research)
2. Know your value (accomplishments)
3. Get competing offers (if possible)
4. Decide minimum acceptable
5. Decide asking price (20-30% above minimum)

During negotiation:
1. Don't anchor low (they'll anchor lower)
2. Let them make first offer
3. Always counter offer
4. Negotiate total comp (salary + bonus + stock)
5. Get timeline for review/raise

Negotiation template:
"Based on my research, my skills, and 
market rates, I was expecting [$X]. 
I'm excited about this role and flexible 
on total compensation package. 
What can you offer?"

What NOT to say:
- "I need this job"
- "I'll take whatever"
- "My last salary was..."
- "I have other offers" (unless true)
```

### Compensation Breakdown

```
Total Comp = Base + Bonus + Stock + Benefits

Example offer (Senior Engineer):
- Base: $150,000
- Bonus: 20% = $30,000
- Stock: $80,000/year (4-year vesting)
- Benefits: $20,000 (health, 401k, etc)
- Total Year 1: $180,000

Negotiate each component:
- Base: Easier to increase
- Bonus: Depends on performance
- Stock: More risk (company dependent)
- Benefits: Usually fixed
```
