## Example Responses

### "What's your greatest weakness?"

```
"I used to struggle with delegation because I wanted 
to handle everything myself. I recognized that this 
slowed down my team. So I worked on being more direct 
with my team, giving clear instructions, and trusting 
them to execute. Now I'm much better at prioritizing 
what only I can do."
```

### "Why do you want to leave your current job?"

```
"I've had a great experience at my current company, 
but I'm looking for a role where I can grow as a

project] aligns with my goals, and I'm excited about 
the opportunity to contribute to that."
```

### "Why should we hire you?"

```
"I bring 5 years of full-stack experience, I'm 
passionate about clean code and testing, and I 
thrive in collaborative environments. In my last 
role, I led the migration to microservices which 
reduced deploy times by 60%. I'm excited to 
contribute that same dedication here."
